    co2BalanceDescription:
      "In a CO<sub>2</sub> balance sheet, direct and indirect emissions caused are recorded. The creation of this balance sheet considers the requirements according to the GHG Protocol. Emissions along the entire product lifecycle can be considered for the calculation, and it is important to clearly distinguish between Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. According to the GHG Protocol, greenhouse gases have different warming potentials. To compare these, the 'Global Warming Potential' (GWP) indicator was created. The GWP is expressed in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents (CO2e) to indicate the relative greenhouse gas potential of CO<sub>2</sub>. The following figure shows the scope consideration along the lifecycle.",
